# agent · control_plane

The agent control plane: the FastAPI app (`api.py`) and orchestration that dispatches work to workers and reconciles routine/meeting lifecycle. Owns request handling, routine bookkeeping, transcription watching, and event relay — distinct from the `worker/` that runs a single agent workload.
