"""``create_app(...) -> FastAPI`` — the ONE uvicorn-able meeting-api modular monolith (P2).

This is the unified meeting-api: ONE FastAPI app composed of front-doored modules, each a
sub-package of ``meeting_api`` mounted here (the v0.12 analog of the parent ``main.py``'s flat
``app.include_router(...)`` list, but each module is an isolated brick behind a port-seam):

  * **lifecycle** — the bot lifecycle callback receiver + meeting-state FSM (lifecycle.v1):
    POST ``/bots/internal/callback/lifecycle``.
  * **bot_spawn** — POST ``/bots``: build the invocation.v1 invocation + mint the MeetingToken +
    spawn the meeting-bot over runtime.v1, eager-creating the MeetingSession on spawn.
  * **collector** — the folded-in transcript backend (collector domain):
    GET ``/transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}``, GET ``/meetings``,
    POST ``/ws/authorize-subscribe`` (+ the ``transcription_segments`` → ``tc:…:mutable`` consumer).
  * **recordings** — POST ``/internal/recordings/upload``, GET ``/recordings``,
    GET ``/recordings/{id}/master`` (chunks + master → ``meeting.data`` JSONB).
  * **obs** — ``TraceMiddleware`` (logevent.v1 trace_id threading) + the shared ``GET /health``.

webhooks + scheduling are library bricks (no HTTP surface of their own in the core path — they are
driven by the lifecycle/bot_spawn flows); they are re-exported from the package front door and wired
by the production composition root in P3. continue_meeting / max-bots / join-retry / the segment
consumer loop are P3 seams.

``create_app`` takes every collaborator as an injected port (or builds a default in-memory stack for
the app factory / tests), so the SAME app runs with real adapters in prod and in-process fakes in
the conformance harness — the conformance assertions therefore drive THIS shipped app.

    records the full diagnostics (``status_transition[]`` + forensics in ``rec.data``). The
    receiver is a bot callback → ``transition_source=bot_callback``. Each advance is ALSO persisted

    status, so the FSM survives a process restart (the in-process store starts empty) and a terminal
    callback reconciles against the durable status. After a persisted advance it PUBLISHES a ws.v1
